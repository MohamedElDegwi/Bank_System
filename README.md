# Bank System Project

A simulation of a real-world banking system implemented in C++ using a 3-tier architecture.

## Overview

The Bank System project is designed to reflect the intricacies of real-world banking operations in a scalable and maintainable manner. Leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and clean code practices, this project embodies efficiency and clarity in its structure.

### Key Features

- **3-Tier Architecture:** Separation of UI, Business, and Database layers for enhanced modularity and maintainability.
- **File Handling with C++ "fstream":** Utilizes the power of C++ and the `fstream` library for seamless data storage and retrieval.

### Object-Oriented Programming

The project embraces key OOP concepts to ensure robustness and flexibility:

- **Classes and Objects:** Extensive use of classes and objects for encapsulation and abstraction.
- **Encapsulation:** Protects the internal state of objects, restricting access to only necessary components for improved security and maintainability.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Enhances code reusability and readability through inheritance and polymorphic behaviors.
- **Abstraction:** Focuses on essential properties and behaviors, hiding unnecessary details to simplify complexity.

### Clean Code Concepts

The implementation adheres to clean code principles, promoting:

- **Fixed Naming Conventions:** Consistent naming methods across the system for improved clarity.
- **Readability:** Ensures the codebase is easy to understand and navigate.
- **Maintainability:** Designed for ease of maintenance, reducing the cost of future updates.

### Screens and Functionality

The system comprises over 20 screens, each embodying clean code practices. The flow of screens facilitates an intuitive user experience, mirroring real-world banking interactions.
